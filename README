statistic
=========

This project contains my statistic exam prep. I go into depth on topics i
require for passing the class. I tried to comment every non trivial line in the
latex source and provide examples for dry chapters.

Tips for writing latex with vim:
--------------------------------

    * use neovim
    * use vimtex
    * use coc-vimtex
    * use treesitter
    * open zathura or okular pointed to the output pdf on the side, both will
      reload on change

Required Tools and libraries:
-----------------------------

    * make
    * texlive
    * pdflatex
    * pgfplots
    * amsmath
    * amssymb

Produce the pdf file:
---------------------

    make
